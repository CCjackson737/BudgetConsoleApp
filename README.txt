The CSV files included are what I was using to test the project. To access all your data, simply have to do is type in the name on the file minus budget. For example, to access your file/Cameronbudget.csv data
you just type your name. For mine I type Cameron and have access to all my data in my csv file and can do various things with it. However, if you are a new user who doesn't have a csv file made, one will be made in the root
directory of the folder. I could improve by adding descriptions for each function/method along with headers to each file to accurately document each.
